# 😸 Welcome to My GitHub Profile - The 7-Haired Kitten Chronicles

## 🐾 About Me
Hi there! I'm a coding wizard 🧙‍♂️ powered by coffee ☕ and the unconditional love of my kitten... who has exactly **7 hairs**. Yes, I counted them. Twice. 

## 🔢 Why 7?
7 is the perfect number:
- 7 continents 🌍
- 7 seas 🌊
- 7 dwarfs 🧝‍♂️
- 7 hairs on my kitten 🐈‍⬛
- 7 bugs fixed (for now) 🐞

## 📂 What You'll Find Here
This profile is a treasure chest 🏴‍☠️ of code, ideas, and probably a few typos I left in to test your attention to detail. If you like:
- Silly comments
- Spaghetti code 🍝
- Projects that might actually work

Then you're in the right place! 🎉

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- JavaScript for 6 hairs ✨
- HTML for 1 shiny hair ✨
- CSS to style all 7 hairs 🌈

## 🤯 Fun Facts About Me
- My kitten's hairs glow under UV light. (Or so I imagine.)
- My code is faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer.
- Commit messages are 50% jokes, 50% panicked debugging notes.
