<p align="center">Hello! I want to thank Adobe, Mozilla, and all the good people out there because they worked hard to create a community built on respect and trust. We need more good people because together, we build a better worldâ€”one without wars, hate, discrimination, or the destructive things that hold us back. Instead, we move toward creation, progress, and kindness!And Kindness just has to spread like a virus or if you want to better understand it should spread like MUSIC!
