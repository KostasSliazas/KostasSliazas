I’ve officially ended my career as a creator, and you should consider doing the same—before you end up like me, bankrupt. Don’t waste your time. Go kiss a girl or boy, be happy, and just enjoy your life. As I said, nobody is going to give you money or donate. Everything has already been created—don’t try to reinvent the wheel. I’m telling you for the last time, nobody is going to give you money if nobody asked you to do the job. Go find love. Play that song you've listened to a thousand times. Say hello to your neighbors. Tell someone a joke. This world is full of hate, and now is the best time to change it for the better.
